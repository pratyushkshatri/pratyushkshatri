Hi fellow developer(s),

I am Pratyush Kshatri, a data science student at the University of Essex with a passion for open source software.

This profile was created to upload a few of my projects that I have done over the course  of my studies and some
personal projects that are I find interseting. This is mostly for the purpose of finding a job (which is almost
impossible as an immigrant with no working experience - still hoping for the best) as a data scientist with my main
area of interest being using RNN's on real-time data.

I am proficient in Python and its libraries relted to data science so most of the projects uploaded here are in this
scripting languages.

Please feel free to have a look and suggest any changes that you can think of. Any help in improving my skill set is
greatly appreciated.


Thank you and happy coding.
