Hi there!

I'm Pratyush Kshatri, a Data Science graduate with a knack for open-source projects and a love for solving complex problems using data.

This repository is my digital profile — a space where I share projects that span my academic journey and a few personal experiments.
From data wrangling to real-time analysis with RNNs, you'll find a mix of work that reflects my passion and curiosity.

What you'll find here?
  1. Projects built primarily in Python, leveraging its powerful data science libraries.
  2. Applications of machine learning techniques, especially in real-time data processing.
  3. A sprinkle of personal initiatives that I found too intriguing to resist.

Why this profile exists?
  As an immigrant navigating the job market (yes, it’s as challenging as it sounds!), I’m showcasing my work here to connect with opportunities in the data science world.

How you can help?
  1. Feedback: Have suggestions or tips? I’m all ears!
  2. Collaboration: Got an exciting idea or project? Let’s team up!
  3. Opportunities: If you're looking for a data scientist with a flair for problem-solving, drop me a message!

Thanks for stopping by and happy coding!!
